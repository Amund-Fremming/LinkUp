# THERE IS A BUG
- So the mysterious thing is that sometimes it works fine and sometimes buggy
- COULD BE - idk how but could be because the events is created in swagger with bad data but should not
- Lays within the fetching of events in general, because getting the eventrelation for the event doesnt work
- TO recreate the bug, join an event from the public feed and then navigate fast to the joined feed/tab and reload, it is an error on the userrelation for the event or something
    - Did happen the other way around before as well, but did not happen now in the last many attempts

## THERE IS ALSO A STYLING BUG
    - when scrolling down, the cards borders will be wider than the tab-shits border radius, should be a quick fix but saw it now at the end
